	<h1>My Bio</h1>
	<p>My name is Emily Van Milligen and I am originally from Santa Rosa CA, but currently am a second year undergraduate at Tufts University. I am a Math and Physics major, however I also have taken/taught many art classes, giving me a unique perspective. I always look for opportunities to help my community and in high school in particular I spent a lot of time attempting to spread my interest in the STEM fields to local girls. I enjoy working with people, and at Tufts am a leader for a volunteer program called Halloween on the Hill, which hosts many halloween themed activities for the children in Medford/Somerville to partake in. I am also on the staff of Tufts Wilderness Orientation (TWO), where incoming freshmen and transfers are taken on a 5 day student-led outdoor trip (whether it be backpacking, canoeing, hybrid, or trail crew) to facilitate bonding before the beginning of the school year. I am currently working as a Modern Physics Classroom Aid as well as in Professors Cebe's Polymer Physics Lab. I am constantly looking for new oppurtunities to get involved in my schoolâ€™s departments and thus further challenge myself.</p>
