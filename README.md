Purpose:To provide access to my Resume and Bio

I worked on this assaignment primarily alone, although did ask a peer (Alexandra Benbadis) for some help, primarily involving git. It took me approximately 5 hours to complete. Everything, from the index to the Bio to the Resume, I believe is implemented correcly, although some stylistic changes may need to be taken later to improve the appearence of the Resume. Perhaps a link back to the index should be provided on the Bio and Resume, although this too can be updated at a later date.
