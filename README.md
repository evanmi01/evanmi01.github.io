Purpose:To provide access to my Resume and Bio

I worked on this assaignment primarily alone, although did ask a peer (Alexandra Benbadis) for some help, primarily involving git. It took me approximately 5 hours to complete. Everything, from the index to the Bio to the Resume, I believe is implemented correcly, although some stylistic changes may need to be taken later to improve the appearence of the Resume. Perhaps a link back to the index should be provided on the Bio and Resume, although this too can be updated at a later date.


My Portfolio
Name:Emily Van Milligen

Purpose:This GitHub repository demonstrates my capabilities as a web developer.

Favorite Assignment: Although this assignment is not infact in my GitHub repository, my favorit assignment was Assignment 3. I did not remotely undersand how server side things worked until I sat down and started this assignment. (I had been very lost in class.) It was not neccessarily the assignment I did the best on, but I felt like I learned the most from it, and in the end I think backend makes more sense. I am therefore very happy the class doesn't stop at client side.

Have I Grown? : YES! On day one I knew NOTHING.  I thought query strings were even a crazy idea. I'm not entirely sure how I had survived in a world that relys so much on the Internet and other servers with as little knowledge as I previously had. Now, although I would not describe myself as a web guru, I consdier myself proficent and I have the tools I need to build up a greater understanding on my own.

Most Important Lesson: Learning to Not Reinvent the Wheel. I have always been one of those people that likes to understand everything about everything, so I always hate using preesxisting code, or blindlu using equations when I dont knwo how they have derived. However, web deveolpment is such a massive field, it is impossible not to use other peopels work. Whether I was using the Google API in Assignment 2 or Bootstrap in the group project, I have learned that useing oher peoples work is not only useful, but often very neccessary.  

Future Topics of Interest: I said that assignment 3 was my favorite, but I also found the final assignment very intereseting. I would be very interested in taking a security class at somepoint since I feel as though we only touched on all the things that can be done in that area.
